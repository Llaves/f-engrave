This is a modified version of F-engrave by Scorchworks.


Some of the goals for modification:
1. A more intelligent guess at your working directory for file saving and opening.
2. Automate the saving of all three gcode files: v_carve, v_clean, sq_clean
3. Single inlay checkbox to simplify this process.
4. Better saving and loading of most recently used settings.
